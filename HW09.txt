1) What is an advantage to using floating point instead of fixed point? 

An advantage to using floating point as aposed to fixed point is that it you are able to scale your calculations down to everything between 0 and 1.  Because if floating point there is a greater amount of "numbers" between 0 and 1 you are able to get more precise calculations.  You will also be able to save storage.
